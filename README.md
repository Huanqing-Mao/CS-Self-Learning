# CS Self Learning
Hello! This is a repository for my own learning of Computer Science concepts beyond textbook.  
In addition to the rigorous concept trainings and teachings provided by NUS SoC, these hands-on examples helped me greatly in understanding the concepts more in-depth.  

## Topics Covered:
1. StringBuffer and StringBuilder examples -> Understanding their differences and multi-threading environment in Java
2. Transformer using PyTorch -> Understand the transformers' algorithm, sourced from https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/building-a-transformer-with-py-torch
3. Neural Network with one single layer + with one hidden layer -> sourced from https://machinelearningmastery.com/building-a-single-layer-neural-network-in-pytorch/
4. C syntax learning -> Learning basic syntaxes of C from W3CSchool to explore more lower-level languages.
5. (More to come...)
