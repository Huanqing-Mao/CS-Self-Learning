with `synchronized` keyword: ==> same as StringBuffer

Final buffer content: Thread1 - 0
Thread3 - 0
Thread2 - 0
Thread1 - 1
Thread3 - 1
Thread2 - 1
Thread3 - 2
Thread2 - 2
Thread1 - 2
Thread1 - 3
Thread2 - 3
Thread3 - 3
Thread2 - 4
Thread3 - 4
Thread1 - 4

without keyword ==> Wrong result because there are multiple threads trying to append at the same time
Final buffer content: Thread1 - 0
Thread3 - 0
Thread2 - 0
Thread1 - 1
Thread3 - 1 // thread 2 didn't append when its i = 1
Thread3 - 2
Thread1 - 2
Thread2 - 2
Thread1 - 3
Thread2 - 3
Thread3 - 3
Thread3 - 4 // thread 1, 2 didn't append when their i = 4

Hence StringBuilder is not Thread-safe
